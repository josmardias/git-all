# git-all
Manage multiple git repos at once

This tools allows you to send commands to multiple repositorys at once.
It's useful for multiple repo projects.

For some reason I don't use git-up and similar tools. I can't explain why.
This tool is not finished, not modular and not beautiful. Sorry about that.
